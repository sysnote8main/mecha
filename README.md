## Introduction

This package provides everything you need for working with Minecraft commands in Python, whether you're looking to process commands or build abstractions on top.

### Features

- Extensible and version-agnostic `mcfunction` parser
- Clean, immutable and hashable abstract syntax tree with source location
- Command config resolver that flattens and enumerates all the valid command prototypes
- Powerful rule dispatcher for processing specific ast nodes
- Composable ast visitors and reducers
- Comes with useful syntactic extensions like relative locations, nesting and implicit execute
- Compile-time scripting with [Bolt](https://github.com/mcbeet/bolt), a subset of Python integrated into command syntax
- Rich function analyzer for keeping track of command statistics
- Execute arbitrary compilation passes in your [`beet`](https://github.com/mcbeet/beet) pipeline
- _(soon)_ Expressive command API for writing commands in Python

## Installation

The package can be installed with `pip`.

```bash
$ pip install mecha
```

## Command-line utility

```bash
$ mecha --help
Usage: mecha [OPTIONS] [SOURCE]...

  Validate data packs and .mcfunction files.

Options:
  -m, --minecraft VERSION  Minecraft version.
  -l, --log LEVEL          Configure output verbosity.
  -s, --stats              Collect statistics.
  -j, --json FILENAME      Output json.
  -v, --version            Show the version and exit.
  -h, --help               Show this message and exit.
```

You can use the command-line utility to check data packs and function files for errors. The command arguments can be zipped and unzipped data packs, individual function files, and if you specify a directory that's not a data pack it will recursively grab all the `.mcfunction` files in the directory. You can use the `--minecraft` option to select between versions `1.16`, `1.17`, and `1.18`.

```bash
$ mecha path/to/my_data_pack
Validating with mecha vX.X.X

ERROR  | mecha  Expected curly '}' but got bracket ']'.
       | path/to/my_data_pack/data/demo/functions/foo.mcfunction:5:34
       |      4 |
       |      5 |  say hello @a[scores={foo=1, bar=2]
       |        :                                   ^

Error: Reported 1 error.
```

The `--stats` option will output a report that shows how many commands, selectors and scoreboards were used. You can also use the `--json` option to output the raw statistics in a json file.

## Github action

You can use `mecha` to check your data packs and function files for errors without having to install anything using the [`mcbeet/check-commands`](https://github.com/mcbeet/check-commands) github action.

```yml
# .github/workflows/check-commands.yml
name: Check commands
on: [push]

jobs:
  check:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - uses: mcbeet/check-commands@v1
        with:
          source: .
```

This allows you to make sure that your commands don't contain any error when you push to your repository. For more details check out the [action README](https://github.com/mcbeet/check-commands#usage).

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome. Make sure to first open an issue discussing the problem or the new feature before creating a pull request. The project uses [`poetry`](https://python-poetry.org/).

```bash
$ poetry install
```

You can run the tests with `poetry run pytest`.

```bash
$ poetry run pytest
```

The project must type-check with [`pyright`](https://github.com/microsoft/pyright). If you're using VSCode the [`pylance`](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.vscode-pylance) extension should report diagnostics automatically. You can also install the type-checker locally with `npm install` and run it from the command-line.

```bash
$ npm run watch
$ npm run check
```

The code follows the [`black`](https://github.com/psf/black) code style. Import statements are sorted with [`isort`](https://pycqa.github.io/isort/).

```bash
$ poetry run isort mecha tests
$ poetry run black mecha tests
$ poetry run black --check mecha tests
```
